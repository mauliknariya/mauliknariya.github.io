I am a postdoctoral fellow in computational biology in the labs of Peter Sorger, Department of Systems Biology and Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology (LSP) at the Harvard Medical School. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Kansas where I was jointly supervised by Eric Deeds and Jack Shi. For my dissertation research I applied non-linear dynamics and rule-based modeling to formulate a mathematical description of the assembly of type III secretion system, a complex structure that allows pathogenic bacteria such as *Salmonella* to invade and infect host cells. For my postdoctoral research I have been analyzing multi-omics datasets such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, to understand the pharmacologic response of cancer cells to therapeutic compunds. I am also interested in developing computational methods and tools for bioinformatics datasets.
