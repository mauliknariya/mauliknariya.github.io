I am a postdoctoral fellow in computational biology in the Department of Systems Biology and the Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School. For my postdoctoral research I have been analyzing multi-omics datasets such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, to understand the pharmacologic response of cancer cells to therapeutic compounds. I am also interested in developing computational methods and tools for bioinformatics datasets. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Kansas where I was jointly supervised by Eric Deeds and Jack Shi. For my [dissertation](https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/28047) research I applied non-linear dynamics and rule-based modeling to formulate a mathematical description of the assembly of the type III secretion system, a complex structure that allows pathogenic bacteria such as *Salmonella* to invade and infect host cells.
