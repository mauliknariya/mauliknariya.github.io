I am postdoctoral fellow in computational biology in the department of [Developmental Biology and Stem Cells](https://www.igbmc.fr/recherche/departements/biologie-du-developpement-et-cellules-souches) at the Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire mentored by [Nacho Molina](https://www.igbmc.fr/igbmc/missions/annuaire/nacho-molina). For my postdoctoral research I have been developing biophsyical models of transcription factor binding for the Ikaros family proteins. I have also been studying the dynamics of gene regulation during the cell cycle in pluripotent stem cells.  

Previously I was a  postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Systems Biology](https://sysbio.med.harvard.edu/) and the [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/about/) at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) mentored by [Peter Sorger](https://sysbio.med.harvard.edu/peter-sorger). I was analyzing multi-omics datasets such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, to understand the pharmacologic response of cancer cells to therapeutic compounds. I am also interested in developing computational methods and tools for bioinformatics datasets. 

I earned my Ph.D. from the [University of Kansas](https://ku.edu/) where I was jointly supervised by [Eric Deeds](https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/faculty/eric-deeds/) and [Jack Shi](https://physics.ku.edu/shi-jicong-jack). For my [dissertation](https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/28047) research I applied non-linear dynamics and rule-based modeling to formulate a mathematical description of the assembly of the type III secretion system, a complex structure that allows pathogenic bacteria such as *Salmonella* to invade and infect host cells.
