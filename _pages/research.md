### Mathematical models for length control in bacterial structures

Bacterial cells construct many structures, such as the flagellar hook and the type III secretion system (T3SS) injectisome, that aid in crucial physiological processes.The length of these channels must be highly regulated in order for these structures to perform their intended functions. There are two leading mechanisms for length regulation in the flagellar hook and T3SS needle: the substrate switching mechanism, in which the length is controlled by assembly of an inner rod, and the ruler mecchanism, in which a molecular ruler controls the length. Using principles from dynamical systems, probability theory, and Gillespie algorithm, we developed mathematical models for these mechanisms. Our models suggest that for the susbtrate switching mechanism the variance in length distribution of these structures would scale quadractically with the average length, whereas for the ruler mechanism the variance would scale linearly with the average length. These findings shed new light on the trade-offs that may have led to the evolution of different length control mechanisms in different bacterial species.
