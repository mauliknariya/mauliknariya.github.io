Music
======
In my free time I like to play the guitar, sing, and sometimes write my own music. My biggest claim to fame is that I performed at the [venue](http://thebottlenecklive.com/) where bands like Foo Fighters and Pearl Jam once did (it was just an open mic, but still). I am also a big music nerd; be it rock or baroque, tell me something that I don't know and I will be all ears.


Cooking
=======
I also like to cook, especially with other people. During grad school I really enjoyed hosting potlucks and exchanging recipes. I am compiling a collection of [recipes](http://mauliknariya.github.io/files/recipes.pdf), some of them are original, others are borrowed from friends or from the web. One of my life goals is to learn to cook at least one authentic dish from each continent.

Carpentry
==========
I have always been fascinated by carpentry. With some powertools and YouTube, I made a [desk](http://mauliknariya.github.io/images/desk.jpg), a [bookshelf](http://mauliknariya.github.io/images/bookshelf.jpg), and a [nightstand](http://mauliknariya.github.io/images/nightstand.jpg) as my beginner woodworking projects. I have a long way to go. If I ever get a chance to go on a sabbatical, I would like to train in the Japanese style of woodworking.
