# Abstract
Bacteria construct many structures, like the flagellar hook and the type III secretion system, that aid in crucial processes such as locomotion and pathogenesis. Experimental work has suggested two competing mechanisms bacteria could use to regulate length in these structures: the “ruler” mechanism and the “substrate switching” mechanism. In this work, we constructed a mathematical model of length control based on the ruler mechanism, and found that the predictions of this model are consistent with experimental data not just for the scaling of the average length with the ruler protein length, but also the variance. Interestingly, we found that the ruler mechanism allows for the evolution of needles with large average lengths without the concomitant large increase in variance that occurs in the substrate switching mechanism. These findings shed new light on the trade-offs that may have lead to the evolution of different length control mechanisms in different bacterial species.
