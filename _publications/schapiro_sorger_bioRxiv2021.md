# Abstract
Highly multiplexed tissue imaging makes molecular analysis of singlecells possible in a preserved spatial context. However,reproducible analysis of the underlying data posesa substantial computational challenge. Here we describe a modular and open-source computational pipeline (MCMICRO) for performing the sequential steps needed to transform large, multi-channelwhole slide images into single-cell data. We demonstrate use of MCMICRO on images of different tissues and tumors acquired using multiple imagingplatforms, thereby providing a solid foundation for the continueddevelopment of tissue imaging software.
